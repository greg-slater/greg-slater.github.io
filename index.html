    <p class = "f4 lh-copy baskerville">
      I’m a data analyst with a passion for coding and creative visualisations,
      and interests in open data, cities & urban mobility, maps, and sustainability. <br> <br>
      I currently work as a data analyst at the <a href="https://europe.edf.org/">Environmental Defense Fund Europe</a>,
      where I’ve been responsible for turning large and complex datasets into stories
      which help advocate for policy solutions to London’s air pollution problem. <br> <br>
      Below are some of the pieces of work I've completed over the last couple of years.

      to scrape every ingredient from any recipe classed as Italian on the BBC food website.
      Then, after a bit of analysis used <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> to create
      a network style visualisation to show how common ingredients are, and what other
      ingredients they tend to appear alongside.
