    <p class = "f4 lh-copy baskerville">
      I’m a data analyst with a passion for coding and creative visualisations,
      and interests in open data, cities & urban mobility, maps, and sustainability. <br> <br>
      I currently work as a data analyst at the <a href="https://europe.edf.org/">Environmental Defense Fund Europe</a>,
      where I’ve been responsible for turning large and complex datasets into stories
      which help advocate for policy solutions to London’s air pollution problem. <br> <br>
      Below are some of the pieces of work I've completed over the last couple of years.

          campaign in London, which used both car-mounted, mobile and low-cost, stationary sensors.

        The data was gathered using Python scripts to query the <a href="https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3">Yelp API</a>

        <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a> and <a href="https://mappa.js.org/">Mappa.js</a>,
        as well as <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>.

      A bit of an experiment into web scraping and visualisation using a

    </p>
    <p class = "f5 lh-copy baskerville">
      First, I used the Python package <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a>
      to scrape every ingredient from any recipe classed as Italian on the BBC food website.
      Then, after a bit of analysis used <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> to create
      a network style visualisation to show how common ingredients are, and what other
      ingredients they tend to appear alongside.
